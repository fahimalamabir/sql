    "### Learning to COUNT\n",
    "What if you want to count the number of employees in your employees table? The COUNT statement lets you do this by returning the number of rows in one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this code gives the number of rows in the ```people``` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*)\n",
    "FROM people;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you've seen, ```COUNT(*)``` tells you how many rows are in a table. However, if you want to count the number of non-missing values in a particular column, you can call COUNT on just that column.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to count the number of birth dates present in the people table:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(birthdate)\n",
    "FROM people;\n",
    "```\n",
    "It's also common to combine COUNT with DISTINCT to count the number of distinct values in a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this query counts the number of distinct birth dates contained in the people table:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT birthdate)\n",
    "FROM people;\n",
    "```\n",
    "In SQL, the ```WHERE``` keyword allows you to filter based on both text and numeric values in a table. There are a few different comparison operators you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - = equal\n",
    "    - <> not equal\n",
    "    - < less than\n",
    "    - > greater than\n",
    "    - <= less than or equal to\n",
    "    - >= greater than or equal to\n",
    "For example, you can filter text records such as title. The following code returns all films with the title 'Metropolis':\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT title\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE title = 'Metropolis';\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that the WHERE clause always comes after the FROM statement!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following query selects all details for films with a budget over ten thousand dollars:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE budget > 10000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this query gets the titles of all films which were filmed in China:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SELECT title\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE country = 'China';\n",
    "```\n",
    "Get the name and birth date of the person born on November 11th, 1974. Remember to use ISO date format ('1974-11-11')!\n",
    "\n",
    "```SELECT name\n",
    "FROM people\n",
    "WHERE birthdate = '1974-11-11';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Get the number of Hindi language films.\n",
    "```\n",
    "select count(language)\n",
    "from films\n",
    "where language = 'Hindi'\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### WHERE AND\n",
    "Often, you'll want to select data based on multiple conditions. You can build up your WHERE queries by combining multiple conditions with the AND keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT title\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE release_year > 1994\n",
    "AND release_year < 2000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "gives you the titles of films released between 1994 and 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you need to specify the column name separately for every AND condition, so the following would be invalid:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SELECT title\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE release_year > 1994 AND < 2000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can add as many AND conditions as you need!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get the title and release year for all Spanish language films released before 2000.\n",
    "```\n",
    "select title, release_year\n",
    "from films\n",
    "where language = 'Spanish' and release_year < 2000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Get all details for Spanish language films released after 2000, but before 2010.\n",
    "```\n",
    "select *\n",
    "from films\n",
    "where language = 'Spanish' and release_year > 2000 and release_year < 2010;\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### WHERE AND OR\n",
    "What if you want to select rows based on multiple conditions where some but not all of the conditions need to be met? For this, SQL has the OR operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following returns all films released in either 1994 or 2000:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT title\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE release_year = 1994\n",
    "OR release_year = 2000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that you need to specify the column for every OR condition, so the following is invalid:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT title\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE release_year = 1994 OR 2000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "When combining AND and OR, be sure to enclose the individual clauses in parentheses, like so:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT title\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)\n",
    "AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');\n",
    "```\n",
    "Otherwise, due to SQL's precedence rules, you may not get the results you're expecting!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following query selects all films that were released in 1994 or 1995 which had a rating of PG or R.\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT title\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)\n",
    "AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Get the title and release year for films released in the 90s.\n",
    "\n",

    "select title, release_year\n",
    "from films\n",
    "where release_year >= 1990 and release_year < 2000;\n",

    "#### BETWEEN\n",
    "As you've learned, you can use the following query to get titles of all films released in and between 1994 and 2000:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT title\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE release_year >= 1994\n",
    "AND release_year <= 2000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Checking for ranges like this is very common, so in SQL the BETWEEN keyword provides a useful shorthand for filtering values within a specified range. This query is equivalent to the one above:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT title\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE release_year\n",
    "BETWEEN 1994 AND 2000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "It's important to remember that BETWEEN is inclusive, meaning the beginning and end values are included in the results!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a table called kids. We can get the names of all kids between the ages of 2 and 12 from the United States:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT name\n",
    "FROM kids\n",
    "WHERE age BETWEEN 2 AND 12\n",

    "- Now restrict the query to only return Spanish language films.\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT title, release_year\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000\n",
    "AND budget > 100000000\n",
    "AND language = 'Spanish'\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Finally, modify to your previous query to include all Spanish language or French language films with the same criteria as before. Don't forget your parentheses!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT title, release_year\n",
    "FROM films\n",
    "WHERE release_year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000\n",
    "AND budget > 100000000\n",
    "AND (language = 'Spanish' or language = 'French');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### WHERE IN\n",
    "As you've seen, WHERE is very useful for filtering results. However, if you want to filter based on many conditions, WHERE can get unwieldy. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT name\n",
    "FROM kids\n",
    "WHERE age = 2\n",
    "OR age = 4\n",
    "OR age = 6\n",
    "OR age = 8\n",
    "OR age = 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter the IN operator! The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause, making it easier and quicker to specify multiple OR conditions! Neat, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the above example would become simply:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT name\n",
    "FROM kids\n",
    "WHERE age IN (2, 4, 6, 8, 10);\n",
    "```"

    "```\n",
    "#### NULL and IS NULL\n",
    "In SQL, NULL represents a missing or unknown value. You can check for NULL values using the expression IS NULL. For example, to count the number of missing birth dates in the people table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SELECT COUNT(*)\n",

    "\n",
    "In SQL, the LIKE operator can be used in a WHERE clause to search for a pattern in a column. To accomplish this, you use something called a wildcard as a placeholder for some other values. There are two wildcards you can use with LIKE:\n",
